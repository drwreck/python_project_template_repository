## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/python_project_template_repository.git
   cd python_project_template_repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use `pip` to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you're using a different dependency manager like `pipenv` or `poetry`, please refer to their documentation for the equivalent commands.

## Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

### Using `venv`:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   python3 -m venv venv

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   source venv/bin/activate

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

   deactivate

---

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and activated your virtual environment, you can run the main application with:

````bash
python main.py


For additional scripts or modules, please refer to the inline documentation or the specific file headers.
